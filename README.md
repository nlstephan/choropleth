# Draw Choropleth

Python program that draws a choropleth map based on user inputs. These inputs include a shapefile path, the quantifiable attribute of the shapefile to map, the number of data classes (2-9), and the desired data classification method (equal interval or quantile).

This program was created for a class project and utilizes source code from my professor and matplotlib to display the map.
